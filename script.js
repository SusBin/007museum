      "description": "Among the longest running of post-war sportscars, the Esprit first surfaced as a Giorgetto Giugiaro-designed Ital Design project car at the 1972 Turin Motor Show, the silver prototype having come about following a chance encounter between Giugiaro and Lotus boss Colin Chapman. The car was well received, and following a protracted development programme finally entered production in 1976. The Esprit retained Lotus’s trademark backbone chassis but deviated from previous designs by employing front and rear sub-frames to support the all-independent suspension and engine/gearbox unit. Lotus’s own 2-litre, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine provided the power while the five-speed transaxle was sourced from Citroën. Disc brakes were fitted to all four wheels, the rears being mounted inboard.",

The design is a little bit more edgy than it used to be –during that time. Exterior in Calypso Red and interior in Champagne only 6 made.<p/>\n\n<p>This is also an example where Colin Chapman (founder of Lotus) used the knowledge from building and competing in – Formula One. Every driver loves the car and its agility.</p>\n<p>It was Chapman who developed the concept to build light-weight cars.</p>\n\n<p>There is just a few of them left in a good condition – that´s why the price goes up -continuously - in the UK. (In the US – even more.)</p>\n\n <p>At the beginning of the film, a white Lotus Turbo Esprit was used, while Roger Moore investigated Gonzale's House. 2 bad guys attempted to break into the car, however, the security system activated and blew up the car! Not very clever security device if you ask me. The second car was a copper coloured Turbo Esprit, shown here, featuring a ski rack on the rear louvers. There were two identical copper cars used in the filming. The second being purchased directly from Lotus Cars in 1998. The car below was actually Lotus's 1980 Turbo Esprit prototype and was originally white, but the car was painted copper, so it would show up against the snowy backgrounds in the film. Both cars helped give the Esprit Turbo some much need promotion and increased the profile of the car to the general public.</p>\n\n<p>After the popularity of the white Lotus Esprit S1, in the 1977 James Bond Film, The Spy Who Loved Me, the new Turbo Esprit was featured in the 1981 film, For Your Eyes Only. Where as the Esprit in the Spy Who Loved me was \"an all sing, all dance\" submarine, the Turbo Esprit's took on less ambitious roles in the film.<p>",
